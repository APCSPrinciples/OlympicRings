Olympic Rings
=======================
In this assignment you will write a program that produces a design similar to the Olympic Rings with 5 differently colored circles. Your program might use the following functions (some more than once):
```python
strokeWeight()
stroke()
ellipse()
size()
noFill()
```

Suggested steps to complete the assignment
------------------------------------------
1. You may find the videos [Making Drawings with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pt/making-drawings-with-code) and [Coloring with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/pt/coloring-with-code) helpful.
2. Sign up for a free account at [p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/signup) and then start a new program.
3. Give your program a meaningful name like `OlympicRings`

Optional Challenge
------------------
Your Olympic rings don't have to look like any of the samples below. Feel free to read about other [Processing functions](http://py.processing.org/reference/) and add other elements to your Olympic rings design. If you want a challenge, you might try to use the [`arc()`](http://py.processing.org/reference/arc.html) function instead of `ellipse()` to make *interlocking* rings like Henry and Emma's programs below.
