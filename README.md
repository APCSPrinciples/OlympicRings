Olympic Rings
=======================
In this assignment you will write a program that produces a design similar to the Olympic Rings with 5 differently colored circles. Your program will use the following functions (some more than once):
<pre><code>
strokeWeight()
stroke()
ellipse()
size()
noFill()
</code></pre> 
 
Optional Challenge
------------------
Your Olympic rings don't have to look like any of the examples. Feel free to read about other Processing functions and add other elements to your Olympic design. If you want a challenge, you might use the `arc()` function instead of `ellipse()` to make interlocking rings.
