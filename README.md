Olympic Rings
=======================
In this assignment you will write a program that produces a design similar to the Olympic Rings with 5 differently colored circles. We will write our first JavaScript program using the [P5 online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). You will want to start by visitng the website and creating an account. Then you will see a screen that looks like this:

![](Olympic1.JPG)   

You will notice the program is divided in to two parts or`function`s: `setup()` and `draw()`. In this assignment we'll leave the `setup()` as is and work with the draw function. Let's start by changing the background color to magenta. Change line 5 to `background(255,0,255);` and press the play button. You should now see a magenta background.

Experiment with the background until you are happy with it. Now lets start on our first ring. Add code after line 6 like this:

In this assignment you will write a program that produces a design similar to the Olympic Rings with 5 differently colored circles. Your program might use the following functions (some more than once):
```python
strokeWeight()
stroke()
ellipse()
size()
noFill()
```

Suggested steps to complete the assignment
------------------------------------------
1. You may find the videos [Making Drawings with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pt/making-drawings-with-code) and [Coloring with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/pt/coloring-with-code) helpful.
2. Sign up for a free account at [p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/signup) and then start a new program.
3. Give your program a meaningful name like `OlympicRings`

Optional Challenge
------------------
Your Olympic rings don't have to look like any of the samples below. Feel free to read about other [Processing functions](http://py.processing.org/reference/) and add other elements to your Olympic rings design. If you want a challenge, you might try to use the [`arc()`](http://py.processing.org/reference/arc.html) function instead of `ellipse()` to make *interlocking* rings like Henry and Emma's programs below.
