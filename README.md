Olympic Rings
=======================
In this assignment you will write a program that produces a design similar to the Olympic Rings with 5 differently colored circles. Your program will use the following functions (some more than once):
```python
strokeWeight()
stroke()
ellipse()
size()
noFill()
```
 
Optional Challenge
------------------
Your Olympic rings don't have to look like any of the samples below. Feel free to read about other [Processing functions](http://py.processing.org/reference/) and add other elements to your Olympic design. If you want a challenge, you might try to use the `arc()` function instead of `ellipse()` to make *interlocking* rings like Emma's program.
